    """This file demonstrates how to start a controller_manager and load a simple controller.

    Since ROS2 doesn't have a central parameter server, each process stores the parameters passed to it on their own. These will be used anytime a node is spawned within this process. This can lead to problems when using e.g. generic remaps on a process creating multiple nodes (e.g. composers, ros2 control manager, etc.), as all arguments (params, remaps, etc.) will apply to them - including names and namespaces.

    More details on this can be found here: https://control.ros.org/humble/doc/ros2_control/controller_manager/doc/userdoc.html#using-the-controller-manager-in-a-process.

    In order to avoid the aforementioned problems, params and remaps can be prefixed with a namespace or node name in order to make them more selective. This is done automatically when using `BetterLaunch.load_params`.
